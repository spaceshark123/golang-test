# Go Testing

This project is a testing grounds for my journey learning the Go (golang) language. Go is a fast statically typed, compiled high-level general purpose programming language. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is known as being a more refined version of C, mixing in elements of Python as well, which makes it useful in the modern world.
